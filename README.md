# Fly Farming
This was originally created for my coding class, but I decided to share with the world because why not. Let's see who is indeed the best farmer!
<br/>
### So wth do I do here?
I added a print statement in the beginning of the game, but here's how to play:
* Accelerate with arrow keys (UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT) *Note: WASD support coming soon!*
* Collect flies (Brown and slow) to earn income *Note: If you can't seem to pick up the fly, try speeding up*
* Make sure to avoid the dark matter flies (Purple and crazy) *Note: Break protection coming soon!*
* You'll get a random tax amount at the start of the day, and it will remain constant until the end of the day *Note: Tax reveal at the beginning of the day coming soon!*
* This game does **NOT** use sprites, so the collisions might be a bit buggy, but should function okay-ish
* It took me 3 class periods (~ 2 hours) to develop the current version (not counting the readme)
<br/>

## Thank you for the time :) please enjoy the game
#### NOTE: This requires an okay cpu since it's directly impacted by the CPU performance.
